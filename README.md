## Description 

This Quiz is about testing users knowledge about a specific series on Netflix called Office US. As soon as the user opens up the website they are given a set of rules and introduced to the quiz. The rules will explain to the user the quiz has a time limit and each question they get correct or wrong they will be given a point, it also explains they cannot quit the quiz once it has started which is why i introduce the rules at the start of the page to let the users know and fully understand what is going on. The quiz is very basic and easy to use and follow. So it's beginner friendly. The Quiz also has a progress bar showing users how much they have progressed through the quiz knowing if they are near the end, however there is a catch. There is a time limit placed for each question to test the users knowledge on the spot. I have randomised the questions to prevent users into refreshing the page and try to do the same questions again till they get it correct. Once the user has completed the Quiz they will be given their result and decide weather they are a true Office US fan or not. 

## Target-audience
