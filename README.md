## Description 

This Quiz is about testing users knowledge about a specific series on Netflix called Office US. As soon as the user opens up the website they are given a set of rules and introduced to the quiz. The rules will explain to the user the quiz has a time limit and each question they get correct or wrong they will be given a point, it also explains they cannot quit the quiz once it has started which is why i introduce the rules at the start of the page to let the users know and fully understand what is going on. The quiz is very basic and easy to use and follow. So it's beginner friendly. The Quiz also has a progress bar showing users how much they have progressed through the quiz knowing if they are near the end, however there is a catch. There is a time limit placed for each question to test the users knowledge on the spot. I have randomised the questions to prevent users into refreshing the page and try to do the same questions again till they get it correct. Once the user has completed the Quiz they will be given their result and decide weather they are a true Office US fan or not. 

## Target-audience

The Quiz is for younger and older adults, it helps the true fans and people that want to test their knowledge about one of their favourite series on Netlfix or their all time favourite series. People of all age groups do get attached to their favourite characters on series and this Quiz is to test them on how much they really like Office US and how much of a true fan or knowledge they know about the series.

## How this Quiz helps

This Quiz helps people that either are really attached to the series or just want to test their knowledge about the Office US. This Quiz keeps track of users correct and incorrect answers, which will help them know what parts of the Office they know more about and less about. The end result of the Quiz will determine weather they have good knowledge about the series or not. They also have the option to try again so users can learn from their mistakes and hopefully get a higher score.

## Wireframes 

I have designed my Quiz code through drawing diagrams with information and adding functions. My ideas and thoughts changed overtime while working through the project.
