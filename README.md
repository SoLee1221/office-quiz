## Description 

This Quiz is about testing users knowledge about a specific series on Netflix called Office US. As soon as the user opens up the website they are given a set of rules and introduced to the quiz. The rules will explain to the user the quiz has a time limit and each question they get correct or wrong they will be given a point, it also explains they cannot quit the quiz once it has started which is why i introduce the rules at the start of the page to let the users know and fully understand what is going on. The quiz is very basic and easy to use and follow. So it's beginner friendly. The Quiz also has a progress bar showing users how much they have progressed through the quiz knowing if they are near the end, however there is a catch. There is a time limit placed for each question to test the users knowledge on the spot. I have randomised the questions to prevent users into refreshing the page and try to do the same questions again till they get it correct. Once the user has completed the Quiz they will be given their result and decide weather they are a true Office US fan or not. 

## Target-audience

The Quiz is for younger and older adults, it helps the true fans and people that want to test their knowledge about one of their favourite series on Netlfix or their all time favourite series. People of all age groups do get attached to their favourite characters on series and this Quiz is to test them on how much they really like Office US and how much of a true fan or knowledge they know about the series.

## How this Quiz helps

This Quiz helps people that either are really attached to the series or just want to test their knowledge about the Office US. This Quiz keeps track of users correct and incorrect answers, which will help them know what parts of the Office they know more about and less about. The end result of the Quiz will determine weather they have good knowledge about the series or not. They also have the option to try again so users can learn from their mistakes and hopefully get a higher score.

## Features

The features my Quiz has are rules to the homepage soon as users open the website they will understand and see what they need to do before beginning the quiz. There is also a pre warning information telling the user when the Quiz start and what to press before the Quiz starts, so that they are not surpised when the Quiz suddently pops up when they click "play" to begin the Quiz. My Quiz has a timer to let the user know how much time they can spend on each question, if they answer it incorrectly an image of the actor will pop up and the name. However if they get the answer correct only an image will pop up with no characters name. They will additionally receive a point for getting answers correct or incorrect. There is also a progress bar to show the user if they are more than half way through the Quiz or towards the end of the Quiz. Once the user has completed the Quiz they will be directed to the result and see their results of incorrect answers, correct answers, total question and percentage. To really understand how well they did in the Quiz or not so good they did in the Quiz there is an option for users to try again however the questions will always come random so that users dont start to pick up patterns on the Quiz.
